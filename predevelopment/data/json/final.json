While this conveys the benefit of being able to listen to some of the videos without consistently watching, the interview questions asked of speakers are sometimes printed on the screen and not asked verbally. If you're not watching, you miss the questions. I would like to see this course refocused on design thinking for 3D printing, with other applications interspersed as examples rather than constituting the lion's share of the course.

If you're not watching, you miss the questions.

There was a clear logic as the professor developed the various ratios.What was missing for me was some in-line quizzes. Not the \\u201ctell me what I just told you type\\u201d but rather ones that make you think. So, for example, in the final video for Week 1, the optional video, instead of just suggesting that the students \\u201cplay\\u201d with the spreadsheet, I think it would be better to give them an actual task or two\\u2026 \\u201cchange the assumption about X to <this value>. What is the impact on the Y ratio? Why?\\u201d I liked that he showed what numbers needed to be changed to make the share valuation closer to $55. But rather than just telling us the answer, this would be another opportunity to have the students stop the video and go try it themselves. With a specific task, it is likely that more students will go and work with the spreadsheet. This is where the real learning takes place.One of the things that I really liked about the design of prior courses by Professor Bushee was the fact that he had examples throughout the videos that had you apply the information right away. But, perhaps this is just me. I know that I learn a lot better by doing rather than just watching the videos and going \\u201cyeah\\u2026 that makes sense. I understand\\u2026\\u201d I also recognize that some students, in past courses, have probably said they don\\u2019t find the in-line quizzes valuable. But, is that a reflection of the value of in-line quizzes as a whole or just in-line quizzes that simply require \\u201cparroting\\u201d something said in the video.I\\u2019m sure that the professor can come up with lots of examples. In Week 1 Video 1 the in-line quiz might provide some numbers for De-levered Net Income, Sales, Average Total Assets and Average Shareholder\\u2019s Equity and asking for the results of each of the ratios in the Dupont Analysis. And maybe a \\u201cthink about what this means\\u201d type question that is not necessarily \\u201cmarked\\u201d but for which an answer is provided in the video. Alternatively, he could have the students change some specific things in the Woof Junction spreadsheet and indicate what impact that has on the ratios and why.Week 1 Video 2 offers lots of similar opportunities with the Profitability and Turnover Ratios. Perhaps requiring the students to work backwards from a specific ratio to determine gross profit would be effective. Or, perhaps a question that relates strategy specifically to the ratios. For example, what would happen to the Gross Margin if Woof introduced a credit card and days receivable increased to 31.6 in 2015? Just something to engage people with the materials.All of the videos offer similar opportunities and I think having specific problems or questions will enhance the learning experience rather than just suggesting that they \\u201cgo look at the spreadsheet\\u201d. The audience for these courses tends to be quite a bit different from your average upper tier university student and probably needs a bit more \\u201chand holding\\u201d and \\u201cdirection\\u201d in order to be successful.Also, if Professor Bushee expects students will watch the optional videos anyway, why make them optional? In the case of the Valuation Video, despite some of the mathematics being a little \\u201cscary\\u201d for some students, I think that the information there is really useful and helps to solidify an understanding of the spreadsheet.I\\u2019m wondering if an in-quiz question would be helpful. Perhaps it might provide a new set of financials for Woof Junction and ask for ratio calculation and what that means in terms of their position in the marketplace or something similar. Just some practice questions to get people working with the information.Same comments basically apply for the remainder of the weeks. I think that it would help the students to have some in-line quizzes \\u2013 this not only breaks up the longer videos and helps to keep students focused but also provides a reinforcement of key concepts.I really liked the quiz for Week 1 even though I struggled with the questions where there are multiple correct responses. The quiz effectively reinforces the information covered very well and requires one to think about what was covered in the lectures.You may want to remind students that the questions may change from quiz to quiz. In many of these on-demand courses, the quiz questions do not change and students may be in the habit of not rereading the questions they have gotten correct on previous attempts.Week 2 \\u2013 Revenue After Cash Collection at 7:39 \\u2013 talking about Days Unearned Revenue and mentions that an \\u201cincrease means slower future recognition\\u201d. A bit more explanation around what that means would be useful.Week 3 \\u2013 no particular additional comments on the lectures other than some in-line questions might be good.. I found Benford\\u2019s Law really interesting.Week 4. It would be really nice to have something to break up the lectures \\u2013 some in-line quiz questions might help. This would also help to reinforce the material.Week 4 quiz Question 9 -, the double negative wording of the question and the correct response may cause confusion for students \\u2013 particularly for those for whom English is not their native language.Overall CommentsI enjoyed the course and learned a lot. I was wondering whether it would be possible to provide a summary document with all the key information from each week related to the ratio calculations and the key things to look for related to those ratios. I know that the ratios are provided in the spreadsheet but it might be good to have a written summary with some supplemental information about how to use the ratios.I think in-line quizzes or practice questions would be helpful for students \\u2013 perhaps ones that asked students to do specific things in the spreadsheet and come back with an answer. They don\\u2019t need to be long or complicated \\u2013 just something that gets people into the spreadsheets and working with them early. You may want to do something stronger to encourage them to \\u201cplay\\u201d with the spreadsheet. Many will feel reluctant to change the numbers in the spreadsheet for fear of \\u201cmessing\\u201d it up. Perhaps a reminder that they can change whatever they want because if they mess something up they can always download it again. Or they can save a copy and play in that leaving the original untouched.It also might be a good idea to have a \\u201cplayground\\u201d sheet where there is a simple set of Financial Statements and the students can try changing things in the financial statements and see the impact on the key ratios without having to move from one spreadsheet to another \\u2013 so, a combination of the Original tab and the first two columns of the Ratios tab. You might even want to have two columns for the ratios \\u2013 one for the ratios with the original numbers that does not change (fixed values) and one for the changed numbers, so students can see the effect of the changes easily.In terms of the spreadsheets, I thought that the Original, the Ratios and the CommonSize tabs were fairly straight forward and relatively easy to understand. That may not be the case for people less familiar with MS-EXCEL but I don\\u2019t know what the target audience is for this course so the students may all be proficient with the tool. On the Valuation tab, I was wondering if the numbers in Row 41 should be highlighted in some way to emphasize that they are Years. That is not clear on first glance.There are a lot of mistakes in the subtitles. I pointed out many of these by flagging the specific videos where they occurred.Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the beta-test of this course.

Personally my peer review experience ranged from listening to fully fleshed out ideas to listening to uninspired loops of nonsense.

If you want to overview the current situation of 3D printing technology and develop so business on 3D printing, you have to watch this\",\"325\":\"Too far from subject\",\"326\":\"This is my feedback as a Beta-Tester for the course:Week 1I thought that the videos were clear, well organized and flowed well from topic to topic. There was a clear logic as the professor developed the various ratios.What was missing for me was some in-line quizzes. Not the \\u201ctell me what I just told you type\\u201d but rather ones that make you think. So, for example, in the final video for Week 1, the optional video, instead of just suggesting that the students \\u201cplay\\u201d with the spreadsheet, I think it would be better to give them an actual task or two\\u2026 \\u201cchange the assumption about X to <this value>. What is the impact on the Y ratio? Why?\\u201d I liked that he showed what numbers needed to be changed to make the share valuation closer to $55. But rather than just telling us the answer, this would be another opportunity to have the students stop the video and go try it themselves. With a specific task, it is likely that more students will go and work with the spreadsheet. This is where the real learning takes place.One of the things that I really liked about the design of prior courses by Professor Bushee was the fact that he had examples throughout the videos that had you apply the information right away. But, perhaps this is just me. I know that I learn a lot better by doing rather than just watching the videos and going \\u201cyeah\\u2026 that makes sense. I understand\\u2026\\u201d I also recognize that some students, in past courses, have probably said they don\\u2019t find the in-line quizzes valuable. But, is that a reflection of the value of in-line quizzes as a whole or just in-line quizzes that simply require \\u201cparroting\\u201d something said in the video.I\\u2019m sure that the professor can come up with lots of examples. In Week 1 Video 1 the in-line quiz might provide some numbers for De-levered Net Income, Sales, Average Total Assets and Average Shareholder\\u2019s Equity and asking for the results of each of the ratios in the Dupont Analysis. And maybe a \\u201cthink about what this means\\u201d type question that is not necessarily \\u201cmarked\\u201d but for which an answer is provided in the video. Alternatively, he could have the students change some specific things in the Woof Junction spreadsheet and indicate what impact that has on the ratios and why.Week 1 Video 2 offers lots of similar opportunities with the Profitability and Turnover Ratios. Perhaps requiring the students to work backwards from a specific ratio to determine gross profit would be effective. Or, perhaps a question that relates strategy specifically to the ratios. For example, what would happen to the Gross Margin if Woof introduced a credit card and days receivable increased to 31.6 in 2015? Just something to engage people with the materials.All of the videos offer similar opportunities and I think having specific problems or questions will enhance the learning experience rather than just suggesting that they \\u201cgo look at the spreadsheet\\u201d. The audience for these courses tends to be quite a bit different from your average upper tier university student and probably needs a bit more \\u201chand holding\\u201d and \\u201cdirection\\u201d in order to be successful.Also, if Professor Bushee expects students will watch the optional videos anyway, why make them optional? In the case of the Valuation Video, despite some of the mathematics being a little \\u201cscary\\u201d for some students, I think that the information there is really useful and helps to solidify an understanding of the spreadsheet.I\\u2019m wondering if an in-quiz question would be helpful. Perhaps it might provide a new set of financials for Woof Junction and ask for ratio calculation and what that means in terms of their position in the marketplace or something similar. Just some practice questions to get people working with the information.Same comments basically apply for the remainder of the weeks. I think that it would help the students to have some in-line quizzes \\u2013 this not only breaks up the longer videos and helps to keep students focused but also provides a reinforcement of key concepts.I really liked the quiz for Week 1 even though I struggled with the questions where there are multiple correct responses. The quiz effectively reinforces the information covered very well and requires one to think about what was covered in the lectures.You may want to remind students that the questions may change from quiz to quiz. In many of these on-demand courses, the quiz questions do not change and students may be in the habit of not rereading the questions they have gotten correct on previous attempts.Week 2 \\u2013 Revenue After Cash Collection at 7:39 \\u2013 talking about Days Unearned Revenue and mentions that an \\u201cincrease means slower future recognition\\u201d. A bit more explanation around what that means would be useful.Week 3 \\u2013 no particular additional comments on the lectures other than some in-line questions might be good.. I found Benford\\u2019s Law really interesting.Week 4. It would be really nice to have something to break up the lectures \\u2013 some in-line quiz questions might help. This would also help to reinforce the material.Week 4 quiz Question 9 -, the double negative wording of the question and the correct response may cause confusion for students \\u2013 particularly for those for whom English is not their native language.Overall CommentsI enjoyed the course and learned a lot. I was wondering whether it would be possible to provide a summary document with all the key information from each week related to the ratio calculations and the key things to look for related to those ratios. I know that the ratios are provided in the spreadsheet but it might be good to have a written summary with some supplemental information about how to use the ratios.I think in-line quizzes or practice questions would be helpful for students \\u2013 perhaps ones that asked students to do specific things in the spreadsheet and come back with an answer. They don\\u2019t need to be long or complicated \\u2013 just something that gets people into the spreadsheets and working with them early. You may want to do something stronger to encourage them to \\u201cplay\\u201d with the spreadsheet. Many will feel reluctant to change the numbers in the spreadsheet for fear of \\u201cmessing\\u201d it up. Perhaps a reminder that they can change whatever they want because if they mess something up they can always download it again. Or they can save a copy and play in that leaving the original untouched.It also might be a good idea to have a \\u201cplayground\\u201d sheet where there is a simple set of Financial Statements and the students can try changing things in the financial statements and see the impact on the key ratios without having to move from one spreadsheet to another \\u2013 so, a combination of the Original tab and the first two columns of the Ratios tab. You might even want to have two columns for the ratios \\u2013 one for the ratios with the original numbers that does not change (fixed values) and one for the changed numbers, so students can see the effect of the changes easily.In terms of the spreadsheets, I thought that the Original, the Ratios and the CommonSize tabs were fairly straight forward and relatively easy to understand. That may not be the case for people less familiar with MS-EXCEL but I don\\u2019t know what the target audience is for this course so the students may all be proficient with the tool. On the Valuation tab, I was wondering if the numbers in Row 41 should be highlighted in some way to emphasize that they are Years. That is not clear on first glance.There are a lot of mistakes in the subtitles. I pointed out many of these by flagging the specific videos where they occurred.Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the beta-test of this course. I hope that my comments are helpful and that I have not missed too much that causes students issues as the course goes live.\",\"327\":\"While I enjoyed this course and the topics covered, I don't feel like the course content matched what the course description stated it was supposed to.

By week two you are able to make an arrangement already.\",\"341\":\"Very Good Informative Course.!!\",\"342\":\"Great intro! The videos were fantastic and instructors very engaging.\",\"343\":\"I really liked The 3D Printing Revolution course. It's easy to understand, you don't need any background knowledge, but you will find out so much about this topic - including materials that are used, technologies, 3D printing companies... Also, the materials cover history and the future of 3D printing. It's a great introductory course and the instructor (and the guests) are amazing. I recommend it!\",\"344\":\"Thank you so much for this course. Really... very neccesary and important for people who loves music.\",\"345\":\"I personally think that I've learnt more from Google and YouTube then in this course. You can join the course for certification. Other then the certificate, I find this course not much of value.\",\"346\":\"Very useful for understanding the basics of 3D printing technology.\",\"347\":\"Don't recommend.You're better off skimming through the ableton manual and using the search function to get the answers you want.\",\"348\":\"I do not find very interesting this course. too many interviews. It could works for the first course, but not for the second. I was expecting to have more technical material and lessons.\",\"349\":\"A great course to teach the basics of this software!\",\"350\":\"The course and the instructor are great, but a missed some referenced material.\",\"351\":\"Practically oriented and brilliantly organized!\",\"352\":\"Great course.

This course is sharp, to the point and makes you sketch out a small track every week - a great way to get involved with the DAW.\",\"356\":\"Lot of considerably complex and dry (accounting and statistics!) subject matter covered at a high level without much discussion!

Some are way too simple and some are highly complex.\",\"357\":\"I did not understand the submitting process till the fourth week. I feel that you could have offered a more detailed description . Doing the review in the fourth week did not do justice for my peers.\",\"358\":\"Program demystifies the evolving world of CIOs in a typical global corporation.Coverage being introductory familiarizes participants nicely through some of the nuances & emerging trends.When I took the course participant numbers was fewer, so feedback was quite delayed. So one should plan to be patient to get their peer reviews.Based on peer reviews i sensed much variations in their expectations.Few sections are in French with Subtitles.Subtitle quality requires audit\\/review.\",\"359\":\"Great introduction\",\"360\":\"The best auditing course out there!\",\"361\":\"This is a really great introductory course on 3D printing. I was completely new to the subject and in just two short modules both the basic techniques and some modern day applications were explained in a really clear and engaging manner.I was also really interested to learn about the business examples that made use of these new technologies.Recommended for anyone who is interested in new and exciting techniques!\",\"362\":\"No practical knowledge learnd and no clear examples of the topics.

Erin Barra did a terrific job of condensing the material . I ended up appreciating the appeal of Ableton Live -- which is to say, a non-linear, clip-based DAW. The program (and Push) is endless, and I'm still learning all sorts of things. Good to have this basic foundation to work from.

I really appreciate that. That one single week of course can literally help so many companies\\/NGOs. That week 4 should be promoted more!!\",\"374\":\"An excellent course.

The course itself is well structured and contains a lot of useful information and that is exactly what I needed in one place.My only complaint is the price of the course - I think it is a bit expensive especially for this first part of the specialisation - it is an introductory two week course with a lot of advertising...\\u00a340..common..are you serious?? A lot of people will buy personal 3D printers or kits after the course, some of them will make a decision to buy a 3D printer for a company they work for (as myself), Fusion 360 subscriptions etc. These companies should sponsor such courses to make them more affordable - it is their interest.I made several courses on Coursera already (Mechanical and Electrical Engineering), they were 5 to 8 weeks and comprised a lot of quite hard work from mentors and students and were only \\u00a332 for certificate.I like the idea of this specialisation but I decided not to pay for the certificate because of its price.

The material is presented in an interesting manner with extensive use of Excel spreadsheets to demonstrate the calculation and application of common performance metrics and ratios. The test are challenging and interesting. I retook test I had passed because the information cover was interesting and the test provided an excellent learning opportunity. The fourth week deals with liking non-financial measures to financial performance. Within a typical organization, these parameters are often the ones employees most affect and are often measured against. The concepts and methods of evaluating presented with examples to demonstrate some of the problems with linking non-financial measures to financial performance.I will be able to use what I have learned from both of these classes in my current job. I evaluate current business strategies of my company against competitive business strategies. Since the competitive business strategies must be deduced from a combination of published information and reported financial performance, the first three weeks will be of greatest benefit in this aspect of my job. The last week will be of more benefit as I help business organization within my company develop their business strategies.\",\"399\":\"Good quality.\",\"400\":\"Interesting course. Motivating instructors. Tests were sometimes a bit too much about semantics and too little about applying knowledge in a practical way (which the course intro hinted on).

I like the style of Professor Bushee's classroom teaching\",\"402\":\"Rather robust material with strong focus on \\\"deceptive\\\" practice detection.

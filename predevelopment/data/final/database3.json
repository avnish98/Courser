There was a clear logic as the professor developed the various ratios.What was missing for me was some in-line quizzes. Not the \u201ctell me what I just told you type\u201d but rather ones that make you think. So, for example, in the final video for Week 1, the optional video, instead of just suggesting that the students \u201cplay\u201d with the spreadsheet, I think it would be better to give them an actual task or two\u2026 \u201cchange the assumption about X to <this value>. What is the impact on the Y ratio? Why?\u201d I liked that he showed what numbers needed to be changed to make the share valuation closer to $55. But rather than just telling us the answer, this would be another opportunity to have the students stop the video and go try it themselves. With a specific task, it is likely that more students will go and work with the spreadsheet. This is where the real learning takes place.One of the things that I really liked about the design of prior courses by Professor Bushee was the fact that he had examples throughout the videos that had you apply the information right away. But, perhaps this is just me. I know that I learn a lot better by doing rather than just watching the videos and going \u201cyeah\u2026 that makes sense. I understand\u2026\u201d I also recognize that some students, in past courses, have probably said they don\u2019t find the in-line quizzes valuable. But, is that a reflection of the value of in-line quizzes as a whole or just in-line quizzes that simply require \u201cparroting\u201d something said in the video.I\u2019m sure that the professor can come up with lots of examples. In Week 1 Video 1 the in-line quiz might provide some numbers for De-levered Net Income, Sales, Average Total Assets and Average Shareholder\u2019s Equity and asking for the results of each of the ratios in the Dupont Analysis. And maybe a \u201cthink about what this means\u201d type question that is not necessarily \u201cmarked\u201d but for which an answer is provided in the video. Alternatively, he could have the students change some specific things in the Woof Junction spreadsheet and indicate what impact that has on the ratios and why.Week 1 Video 2 offers lots of similar opportunities with the Profitability and Turnover Ratios. Perhaps requiring the students to work backwards from a specific ratio to determine gross profit would be effective. Or, perhaps a question that relates strategy specifically to the ratios. For example, what would happen to the Gross Margin if Woof introduced a credit card and days receivable increased to 31.6 in 2015? Just something to engage people with the materials.All of the videos offer similar opportunities and I think having specific problems or questions will enhance the learning experience rather than just suggesting that they \u201cgo look at the spreadsheet\u201d. The audience for these courses tends to be quite a bit different from your average upper tier university student and probably needs a bit more \u201chand holding\u201d and \u201cdirection\u201d in order to be successful.Also, if Professor Bushee expects students will watch the optional videos anyway, why make them optional? In the case of the Valuation Video, despite some of the mathematics being a little \u201cscary\u201d for some students, I think that the information there is really useful and helps to solidify an understanding of the spreadsheet.I\u2019m wondering if an in-quiz question would be helpful. Perhaps it might provide a new set of financials for Woof Junction and ask for ratio calculation and what that means in terms of their position in the marketplace or something similar. Just some practice questions to get people working with the information.Same comments basically apply for the remainder of the weeks. I think that it would help the students to have some in-line quizzes \u2013 this not only breaks up the longer videos and helps to keep students focused but also provides a reinforcement of key concepts.I really liked the quiz for Week 1 even though I struggled with the questions where there are multiple correct responses. The quiz effectively reinforces the information covered very well and requires one to think about what was covered in the lectures.You may want to remind students that the questions may change from quiz to quiz. In many of these on-demand courses, the quiz questions do not change and students may be in the habit of not rereading the questions they have gotten correct on previous attempts.Week 2 \u2013 Revenue After Cash Collection at 7:39 \u2013 talking about Days Unearned Revenue and mentions that an \u201cincrease means slower future recognition\u201d. A bit more explanation around what that means would be useful.Week 3 \u2013 no particular additional comments on the lectures other than some in-line questions might be good.. I found Benford\u2019s Law really interesting.Week 4. It would be really nice to have something to break up the lectures \u2013 some in-line quiz questions might help. This would also help to reinforce the material.Week 4 quiz Question 9 -, the double negative wording of the question and the correct response may cause confusion for students \u2013 particularly for those for whom English is not their native language.Overall CommentsI enjoyed the course and learned a lot. I was wondering whether it would be possible to provide a summary document with all the key information from each week related to the ratio calculations and the key things to look for related to those ratios. I know that the ratios are provided in the spreadsheet but it might be good to have a written summary with some supplemental information about how to use the ratios.I think in-line quizzes or practice questions would be helpful for students \u2013 perhaps ones that asked students to do specific things in the spreadsheet and come back with an answer. They don\u2019t need to be long or complicated \u2013 just something that gets people into the spreadsheets and working with them early. You may want to do something stronger to encourage them to \u201cplay\u201d with the spreadsheet. Many will feel reluctant to change the numbers in the spreadsheet for fear of \u201cmessing\u201d it up. Perhaps a reminder that they can change whatever they want because if they mess something up they can always download it again. Or they can save a copy and play in that leaving the original untouched.It also might be a good idea to have a \u201cplayground\u201d sheet where there is a simple set of Financial Statements and the students can try changing things in the financial statements and see the impact on the key ratios without having to move from one spreadsheet to another \u2013 so, a combination of the Original tab and the first two columns of the Ratios tab. You might even want to have two columns for the ratios \u2013 one for the ratios with the original numbers that does not change (fixed values) and one for the changed numbers, so students can see the effect of the changes easily.In terms of the spreadsheets, I thought that the Original, the Ratios and the CommonSize tabs were fairly straight forward and relatively easy to understand. That may not be the case for people less familiar with MS-EXCEL but I don\u2019t know what the target audience is for this course so the students may all be proficient with the tool. On the Valuation tab, I was wondering if the numbers in Row 41 should be highlighted in some way to emphasize that they are Years. That is not clear on first glance.There are a lot of mistakes in the subtitles. I pointed out many of these by flagging the specific videos where they occurred.Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the beta-test of this course.

There was a clear logic as the professor developed the various ratios.What was missing for me was some in-line quizzes. Not the \u201ctell me what I just told you type\u201d but rather ones that make you think. So, for example, in the final video for Week 1, the optional video, instead of just suggesting that the students \u201cplay\u201d with the spreadsheet, I think it would be better to give them an actual task or two\u2026 \u201cchange the assumption about X to <this value>. What is the impact on the Y ratio? Why?\u201d I liked that he showed what numbers needed to be changed to make the share valuation closer to $55. But rather than just telling us the answer, this would be another opportunity to have the students stop the video and go try it themselves. With a specific task, it is likely that more students will go and work with the spreadsheet. This is where the real learning takes place.One of the things that I really liked about the design of prior courses by Professor Bushee was the fact that he had examples throughout the videos that had you apply the information right away. But, perhaps this is just me. I know that I learn a lot better by doing rather than just watching the videos and going \u201cyeah\u2026 that makes sense. I understand\u2026\u201d I also recognize that some students, in past courses, have probably said they don\u2019t find the in-line quizzes valuable. But, is that a reflection of the value of in-line quizzes as a whole or just in-line quizzes that simply require \u201cparroting\u201d something said in the video.I\u2019m sure that the professor can come up with lots of examples. In Week 1 Video 1 the in-line quiz might provide some numbers for De-levered Net Income, Sales, Average Total Assets and Average Shareholder\u2019s Equity and asking for the results of each of the ratios in the Dupont Analysis. And maybe a \u201cthink about what this means\u201d type question that is not necessarily \u201cmarked\u201d but for which an answer is provided in the video. Alternatively, he could have the students change some specific things in the Woof Junction spreadsheet and indicate what impact that has on the ratios and why.Week 1 Video 2 offers lots of similar opportunities with the Profitability and Turnover Ratios. Perhaps requiring the students to work backwards from a specific ratio to determine gross profit would be effective. Or, perhaps a question that relates strategy specifically to the ratios. For example, what would happen to the Gross Margin if Woof introduced a credit card and days receivable increased to 31.6 in 2015? Just something to engage people with the materials.All of the videos offer similar opportunities and I think having specific problems or questions will enhance the learning experience rather than just suggesting that they \u201cgo look at the spreadsheet\u201d. The audience for these courses tends to be quite a bit different from your average upper tier university student and probably needs a bit more \u201chand holding\u201d and \u201cdirection\u201d in order to be successful.Also, if Professor Bushee expects students will watch the optional videos anyway, why make them optional? In the case of the Valuation Video, despite some of the mathematics being a little \u201cscary\u201d for some students, I think that the information there is really useful and helps to solidify an understanding of the spreadsheet.I\u2019m wondering if an in-quiz question would be helpful. Perhaps it might provide a new set of financials for Woof Junction and ask for ratio calculation and what that means in terms of their position in the marketplace or something similar. Just some practice questions to get people working with the information.Same comments basically apply for the remainder of the weeks. I think that it would help the students to have some in-line quizzes \u2013 this not only breaks up the longer videos and helps to keep students focused but also provides a reinforcement of key concepts.I really liked the quiz for Week 1 even though I struggled with the questions where there are multiple correct responses. The quiz effectively reinforces the information covered very well and requires one to think about what was covered in the lectures.You may want to remind students that the questions may change from quiz to quiz. In many of these on-demand courses, the quiz questions do not change and students may be in the habit of not rereading the questions they have gotten correct on previous attempts.Week 2 \u2013 Revenue After Cash Collection at 7:39 \u2013 talking about Days Unearned Revenue and mentions that an \u201cincrease means slower future recognition\u201d. A bit more explanation around what that means would be useful.Week 3 \u2013 no particular additional comments on the lectures other than some in-line questions might be good.. I found Benford\u2019s Law really interesting.Week 4. It would be really nice to have something to break up the lectures \u2013 some in-line quiz questions might help. This would also help to reinforce the material.Week 4 quiz Question 9 -, the double negative wording of the question and the correct response may cause confusion for students \u2013 particularly for those for whom English is not their native language.Overall CommentsI enjoyed the course and learned a lot. I was wondering whether it would be possible to provide a summary document with all the key information from each week related to the ratio calculations and the key things to look for related to those ratios. I know that the ratios are provided in the spreadsheet but it might be good to have a written summary with some supplemental information about how to use the ratios.I think in-line quizzes or practice questions would be helpful for students \u2013 perhaps ones that asked students to do specific things in the spreadsheet and come back with an answer. They don\u2019t need to be long or complicated \u2013 just something that gets people into the spreadsheets and working with them early. You may want to do something stronger to encourage them to \u201cplay\u201d with the spreadsheet. Many will feel reluctant to change the numbers in the spreadsheet for fear of \u201cmessing\u201d it up. Perhaps a reminder that they can change whatever they want because if they mess something up they can always download it again. Or they can save a copy and play in that leaving the original untouched.It also might be a good idea to have a \u201cplayground\u201d sheet where there is a simple set of Financial Statements and the students can try changing things in the financial statements and see the impact on the key ratios without having to move from one spreadsheet to another \u2013 so, a combination of the Original tab and the first two columns of the Ratios tab. You might even want to have two columns for the ratios \u2013 one for the ratios with the original numbers that does not change (fixed values) and one for the changed numbers, so students can see the effect of the changes easily.In terms of the spreadsheets, I thought that the Original, the Ratios and the CommonSize tabs were fairly straight forward and relatively easy to understand. That may not be the case for people less familiar with MS-EXCEL but I don\u2019t know what the target audience is for this course so the students may all be proficient with the tool. On the Valuation tab, I was wondering if the numbers in Row 41 should be highlighted in some way to emphasize that they are Years. That is not clear on first glance.There are a lot of mistakes in the subtitles. I pointed out many of these by flagging the specific videos where they occurred.Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the beta-test of this course.

There was a clear logic as the professor developed the various ratios.What was missing for me was some in-line quizzes. Not the \u201ctell me what I just told you type\u201d but rather ones that make you think. So, for example, in the final video for Week 1, the optional video, instead of just suggesting that the students \u201cplay\u201d with the spreadsheet, I think it would be better to give them an actual task or two\u2026 \u201cchange the assumption about X to <this value>. What is the impact on the Y ratio? Why?\u201d I liked that he showed what numbers needed to be changed to make the share valuation closer to $55. But rather than just telling us the answer, this would be another opportunity to have the students stop the video and go try it themselves. With a specific task, it is likely that more students will go and work with the spreadsheet. This is where the real learning takes place.One of the things that I really liked about the design of prior courses by Professor Bushee was the fact that he had examples throughout the videos that had you apply the information right away. But, perhaps this is just me. I know that I learn a lot better by doing rather than just watching the videos and going \u201cyeah\u2026 that makes sense. I understand\u2026\u201d I also recognize that some students, in past courses, have probably said they don\u2019t find the in-line quizzes valuable. But, is that a reflection of the value of in-line quizzes as a whole or just in-line quizzes that simply require \u201cparroting\u201d something said in the video.I\u2019m sure that the professor can come up with lots of examples. In Week 1 Video 1 the in-line quiz might provide some numbers for De-levered Net Income, Sales, Average Total Assets and Average Shareholder\u2019s Equity and asking for the results of each of the ratios in the Dupont Analysis. And maybe a \u201cthink about what this means\u201d type question that is not necessarily \u201cmarked\u201d but for which an answer is provided in the video. Alternatively, he could have the students change some specific things in the Woof Junction spreadsheet and indicate what impact that has on the ratios and why.Week 1 Video 2 offers lots of similar opportunities with the Profitability and Turnover Ratios. Perhaps requiring the students to work backwards from a specific ratio to determine gross profit would be effective. Or, perhaps a question that relates strategy specifically to the ratios. For example, what would happen to the Gross Margin if Woof introduced a credit card and days receivable increased to 31.6 in 2015? Just something to engage people with the materials.All of the videos offer similar opportunities and I think having specific problems or questions will enhance the learning experience rather than just suggesting that they \u201cgo look at the spreadsheet\u201d. The audience for these courses tends to be quite a bit different from your average upper tier university student and probably needs a bit more \u201chand holding\u201d and \u201cdirection\u201d in order to be successful.Also, if Professor Bushee expects students will watch the optional videos anyway, why make them optional? In the case of the Valuation Video, despite some of the mathematics being a little \u201cscary\u201d for some students, I think that the information there is really useful and helps to solidify an understanding of the spreadsheet.I\u2019m wondering if an in-quiz question would be helpful. Perhaps it might provide a new set of financials for Woof Junction and ask for ratio calculation and what that means in terms of their position in the marketplace or something similar. Just some practice questions to get people working with the information.Same comments basically apply for the remainder of the weeks. I think that it would help the students to have some in-line quizzes \u2013 this not only breaks up the longer videos and helps to keep students focused but also provides a reinforcement of key concepts.I really liked the quiz for Week 1 even though I struggled with the questions where there are multiple correct responses. The quiz effectively reinforces the information covered very well and requires one to think about what was covered in the lectures.You may want to remind students that the questions may change from quiz to quiz. In many of these on-demand courses, the quiz questions do not change and students may be in the habit of not rereading the questions they have gotten correct on previous attempts.Week 2 \u2013 Revenue After Cash Collection at 7:39 \u2013 talking about Days Unearned Revenue and mentions that an \u201cincrease means slower future recognition\u201d. A bit more explanation around what that means would be useful.Week 3 \u2013 no particular additional comments on the lectures other than some in-line questions might be good.. I found Benford\u2019s Law really interesting.Week 4. It would be really nice to have something to break up the lectures \u2013 some in-line quiz questions might help. This would also help to reinforce the material.Week 4 quiz Question 9 -, the double negative wording of the question and the correct response may cause confusion for students \u2013 particularly for those for whom English is not their native language.Overall CommentsI enjoyed the course and learned a lot. I was wondering whether it would be possible to provide a summary document with all the key information from each week related to the ratio calculations and the key things to look for related to those ratios. I know that the ratios are provided in the spreadsheet but it might be good to have a written summary with some supplemental information about how to use the ratios.I think in-line quizzes or practice questions would be helpful for students \u2013 perhaps ones that asked students to do specific things in the spreadsheet and come back with an answer. They don\u2019t need to be long or complicated \u2013 just something that gets people into the spreadsheets and working with them early. You may want to do something stronger to encourage them to \u201cplay\u201d with the spreadsheet. Many will feel reluctant to change the numbers in the spreadsheet for fear of \u201cmessing\u201d it up. Perhaps a reminder that they can change whatever they want because if they mess something up they can always download it again. Or they can save a copy and play in that leaving the original untouched.It also might be a good idea to have a \u201cplayground\u201d sheet where there is a simple set of Financial Statements and the students can try changing things in the financial statements and see the impact on the key ratios without having to move from one spreadsheet to another \u2013 so, a combination of the Original tab and the first two columns of the Ratios tab. You might even want to have two columns for the ratios \u2013 one for the ratios with the original numbers that does not change (fixed values) and one for the changed numbers, so students can see the effect of the changes easily.In terms of the spreadsheets, I thought that the Original, the Ratios and the CommonSize tabs were fairly straight forward and relatively easy to understand. That may not be the case for people less familiar with MS-EXCEL but I don\u2019t know what the target audience is for this course so the students may all be proficient with the tool. On the Valuation tab, I was wondering if the numbers in Row 41 should be highlighted in some way to emphasize that they are Years. That is not clear on first glance.There are a lot of mistakes in the subtitles. I pointed out many of these by flagging the specific videos where they occurred.Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the beta-test of this course.
